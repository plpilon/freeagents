#Canada's Free Agents

Canada’s Free Agents is a new model for workforce mobilization. It offers public servants the freedom to select work, and matches them with managers looking to rapidly and easily acquire resources their short-term project needs.

##What we do
Canada’s Free Agent finds, recruits, and develops talent – and sets it free.

Free Agents are highly mobile employees. They were each hired after an intense screening process designed to assess strategic thinking, flexibility, leadership, creativity, and teamwork, among other attributes. While most work for federal organizations, the program is flexible enough to allow a free agent to join other types of organizations.

The hiring organization covers their salary and a share of the administrative cost of the program. Often, managers can go from wanting to work with free agents to have one in place in weeks, not months.

Who said HR couldn’t be easy?
